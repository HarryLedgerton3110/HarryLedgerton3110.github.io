            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>Hello! My name is Harry Ledgerton and I am a games development graduate. This is my personal website to show off who I am and everything that I have done!</p>
            <p>I am 22 years old, I am married to my wonderful wife Rhianna and we live in Great Yeldham with our dog, Eeyore, and cat, Tiki. I have a real passion for designing and developing video games. My favourite game of all time is a toss up between Skyrim and Skate 3. My favourite film at the moment is probably The Grand Budapest Hotel (though this does change a lot).</p>
            <p>I am currently playing through the rise of the tomb raider on Xbox as I absolutely loved the 2013 Tomb Raider and haven’t gotten around to playing the rest of the survivor trilogy yet. </p>
            <p>So that’s a little bit about me, feel free to browse the rest of my website to see what projects I have worked on in the past and what I am currently working on at the moment. There is also a section for my current experience in the tech world and my educational background too!</p>
