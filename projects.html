            <h2>An Analysis of Immersion in Horror Games: a study of presence and usability</h2>
            <p>This project was an analysis of immersion in video games. Immersion is defined as a “deep mental involvement in something”. The research is exploring whether this involvement will deepen with VR compared to more traditional methods of play. Bjork and Holopainen (2005) described four types of immersion, Spatial, Emotional, Cognitive, and Sensory-Motoric. Spatial immersion is being focussed on as this is what occurs when  manoeuvring a virtual environment. This happens when players experience what they feel as a “real” world (Rice, 2004). A horror game experience was developed in which two groups of players participated to play the game. 
                The first group of players played the game using a VR headset and the second group using a monitor keyboard and mouse. Each group’s levels of immersion were measured using a range of methods. These included post-game surveys where each participant answered a range of questions to create a set of data for analysis. The system usability scale and the Witmer and Singer presence questionnaire were used for these. Another technique I used is thematic analysis where common themes, topics, ideas and patterns are identified.  These two techniques provided me with quantitative and qualitative  data. The aim of the research was to investigate whether a VR experience is more immersive compared to that of one of a typical monitor. 
                There has been similar research completed in training employees using VR rather than basic methods to induce whether it was more effective or not.  Borsci et al. (2016) conducted research using three methods of training: VR using a CAVE system, traditional video and 3D holographic. The research deduced that VR and 3D holographic produced better performance on the post training test. In order to complete the research; a horror game experience was developed using Unreal Engine 5. The VR version and the Monitor version were identical games with the only difference being the controls, this way more accurate results were obtained as all participants experienced the same stimulus. All participants were kept separate and be asked to not talk about their experience with other participants as this would have caused a bias in the results.
